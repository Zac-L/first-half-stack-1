First Express Half Stack App with ExpressJS
======

## Directions

Convert your vanilla NodeJS http server from previous lab into an ExpressJS app:
  * Use `app.<method>` handlers
  * Use `:id` to handle params
  * Use `body-parser` for request body
  * Use `res.send` or `res.json` for `application/json` responses (remove vanilla content type setting)
  
## Bonus Requirements

* Add the ability to submit a `query` as part of `GET` all. Choose 2 properties that you allow to be queried, 
e.g. `?type=cat`. Query can be 1, both, or none of those properties

## Testing

* Use your existing tests to guide you in your transition
* Add tests for new requirements
